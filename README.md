# RTv1
A simple raytracer with several primitives, multisampling and physical based rendering using Oren-Nayar and Trowbridge-Reitz formulas.
Run "make" to compile the project then run "./RT" or "./RT ./scenes/[scene_name]".
You can move the camera using the direction keys and +/- and save the current scene to "scene.rtscene" using "S"
